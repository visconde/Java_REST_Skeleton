# Java REST Skeleton 

This project is a simple skeleton example for a Java REST Back-End application.

It contains one Entity (Note), and exposes that Entity using REST Web Services 

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

This is Maven project, so all the library requirements are specified in the pom file and nothing else is needed.

The project is meant to run on a web server (I use tomcat)

It also requires a database connection where the objects will be stored and retrieved.

This database connection can be specified directly on the Tomcat server configuration and then set on the persistence.xml file.




```
...
```

### Installing

Just clone the project and open it on NetBeans.

Update the persistence.xml file with the name of the DB Connection and hit run!

```
...
```


## Deployment

hit run on netbeans

go to localhost:8080 (or the port that is configured on the web server) and celebrate!
